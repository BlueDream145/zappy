Epitech Final Second Year Project Zappy, Server in C and Client in CPP

Subject:

The goal of this project is to create a network game.Several teams confront on a tiles map containing resources.The winning team is the one with 6 players who reached maximum elevation.The following pages describe all the details and constraints.

The game consists of managing a world and its inhabitants.This world,Trantoris geographically made up of zero-relief planes: no craters, no valleys, no mountains.The game board represents the entirety of this world’s surface, like a world map.

The environment is rather rich in resources (as many mineral as dietary).Therefore, by walking around this planet, the players can find succulent food and a variety of natural stones.These stones have six distinct categories, as follows:

•linemate
•deraumere
•sibur
•mendiane
•phiras
•thystame

The server must generate randomly these resources.

Trantor’s inhabitants take care of two things:

  •feeding themselves
  •looking for, and collecting, stones
  
These two objectives determine elevation, which is an important activity for the Trantorians.

The inhabitants are bodiless, blurry and takes up the entire tile he/she is in.They are pacifists. They are neither violent nor aggressive.They eat and meander happily in search of stones.They easily run into their fellow creatures on the same terrain.

Trantorians can see as far as his/her visual capacities allow.It is impossible to distinguish his/her direction when we run into them.The food that the Trantorians collect is the only resource they need to survive.One unit of food allows them to live for 126 units of time.
